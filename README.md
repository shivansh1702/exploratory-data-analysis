# exploratory-data-analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and 
investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing 
data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources 
to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover 
patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.
So, in this project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Diwali 
Sales dataset given to us by a company to analyze it and to share with them a 
summary so that they can enhance customer experience and to further increase 
revenue. The dataset is available as Diwali Sales Data.csv. To perform the analysis, the use of 
Python libraries like NumPy,Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn is done.
